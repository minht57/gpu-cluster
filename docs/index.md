# Welcome to GPU Cluster

This website introduces a setup of the GPU Cluster, which a powerful web-based system designed for interactive deep learning development. With this platform, users can easily create, test, and deploy advanced machine learning and deep learning models, all through a simple web browser interface. 

This guide offers a walkthrough of the cluster installation process, following the [Zero to JupyterHub with Kubernetes](https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/) guideline. Additionally, we provide a practical guideline tailored to our specific use case. Explore the world of interactive deep learning development with ease and precision on our GPU Cluster platform.
